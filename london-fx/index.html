        <h2>The Weekend</h2>

        <p>
           We are thrilled to be hosting a Revision Satellite this year. 
           Join us in Limehouse, London, to watch the stream on a big screen with a loud sound system, and most importantly, other sceners!
        </p>

        <p>
           This is a hobby project, we’re just renting a venue, projector and sound system for our friends in the UK demoscene to get together and take part in the Revision Demoparty. 
           Check out the main site here.
        </p>

        <p>
           Anyone who is involved in or interested in the demoscene is welcome. We would love to see you there.

        <h2>The Venue</h2>

        <p>
           The venue is Limehouse Town Hall, 646 Commercial Road, London. We have a maximum capacity of 25 people.
        <p>

        <p>
           It is closed overnight. You will have to make your own sleeping arrangements. We couldn’t find a venue that permitted traditional demoscene sleeping bags under tables.

        <h2>Staying Safe</h2>

        <p>
           We expect you to take an LFT each day and stay home if you are infected. Wear a mask when you are indoors or around other people.
        </p>

        <p>
           Bigotry, harassment, verbal or physical abuse, and anything intended to harm other people at the party is unwelcome and may result in you being barred entry.
        </p>

        <p>
           Don’t let random strangers into the building during the event.
        </p>

        <h2>The Cost</h2>

        <p>
           Reality404 has hired a hall for the weekend, which costs quite a bit of money. We’re asking for an entrance fee of £40 if you can afford it, if you can’t then just pay what you can. 
           We’ll provide a projector, sound system, and maybe some revision goodies. You have to provide the rest.
