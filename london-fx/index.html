        <h2>The Weekend</h2>

        <p>
           We are thrilled to be hosting a Revision Satellite this year. 
           Join us in Limehouse, London, to watch the stream on a big screen with a loud sound system, and most importantly, other sceners!
        </p>

        <p>
           This is a hobby project, weâ€™re just renting a venue, projector and sound system for our friends in the UK demoscene to get together and take part in the Revision Demoparty. 
           Check out the main site here.
        </p>

        <p>
           Anyone who is involved in or interested in the demoscene is welcome. We would love to see you there.
