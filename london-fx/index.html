        <h2>
          This is the London-FX train from Field-FX. Calling at Revison 2022
          only
        </h2>

        <p>
          We are thrilled to be hosting a Revision Satellite this year. Join us
          in Limehouse, London, to watch the stream on a big screen with a loud
          sound system, and most importantly, other sceners!
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a labour of love by enthusiasts. We are renting a venue, a
          projector and sound system for our friends in the UK demoscene to get
          together and take part in the Revision Demoparty.
          <a href="https://2022.revision-party.net/" target="_blank"
            >Check out the main site and the satellite concept here.</a
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          Anyone who is involved in or interested in the demoscene is welcome.
          We would love to see you there.

        <h2>Station details</h2>

        <p>
          The venue is
          <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/HQd1E5fE7h3quL4e7" target="_blank"
            >Limehouse Town Hall, 646 Commercial Road, London</a
          >. We have a maximum capacity of 30 people, please respond soon if you
          are planning to come!
        </p>

        <p>
          We’ll provide a projector, sound system, and maybe some Revision
          goodies (if they arrive in time). There will be power and wifi and
          somewhere to sit (we hope). Need anything else? Bring it!
        </p>

        <p>
          It is closed overnight. You will have to make your own sleeping
          arrangements. We couldn’t find a venue that permitted the traditional
          demoscene activity of sleeping in sleeping bags under tables.

        <h2>Staying Safe</h2>

        <p>
          We expect you to take an LFT each day and stay home if you are
          infected. Wear a mask when you are indoors or around other people. We
          have LFTs on site for you to use.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bigotry, harassment, verbal or physical abuse, and anything intended
          to harm other people at the party is unwelcome and may result in you
          being barred entry.
        </p>

        <p>
          Don’t let random strangers into the building during the event (but
          friends are okay).
        </p>

        <h2>The Cost</h2>

        <p>
          We’re asking you to contribute if you can afford it, if everyone put in TBC the hall would be covered. If you can’t then just pay what you can.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those of you that can't make it, note that the Revision 2022 party
          stream is going to be free for everyone to watch and submit prods to.
