      <h2>Field-FX 2024 - A demoparty in an tent at EMF Camp 2024</h2>
      <p>30th May - 2nd June 2024, Eastnor Park, Ledbury, UK</p>

      <p>
        <a href="http://demoscene-the-art-of-coding.net/the-demoscene/" target="_blank">demoscene</a>, a digital
        <s>frontier</s> arts subculture. And EMF Camp, a festival
        for hackers and creative people to gather, party, and share knowledge.
        We're throwing a demoparty, and everyone at EMF Camp is invited to
        watch, to make entries, and to have a great time. There's a saying on
        the scene, "the real party is outside." Well it doesn't get any more
        outside than this!
      </p>

      <p>
        Our goal is to bring the spirit of the demoscene to more people, and
        to encourage creativity. We hope you will join us!
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyone who has a ticket to EMF Camp can join us on site. If you want
        to watch remotely, we will be streaming the event on
        <a href="https://twitch.tv/fieldfxdemo" target="_blank">Twitch</a>. To
        submit entries (please submit entries!) we will be announcing our
        partynet nearer the event. We are not charging for anything, but
        <a href="https://www.emfcamp.org/tickets" target="_blank">
          EMF tickets</a>
        are sold separately.
      </p>

      <h2>Competitions</h2>
      <h3>Demo</h3>
      <p>
        The central focus of the demoscene, an extravaganza of executable animation and audio, it's the demo compo. 
        We accept entries for newschool platforms (that is, desktop computers, web, etc.) as well as oldschool (8 and 16-bit home computers and consoles), and fantasy consoles such as TIC-80 and Pico-8. 
        <span title="Hi Superogue"> Sizecoded </span> entries are welcome too. 
      </p>
      <h3>Badge / Microcontroller</h3>
      <p>
        This is a hacker camp, so let's do something with a hacker camp vibe!
        Anyone who's seen an EMF Camp badge knows its potential. But maybe you
        have an Arduino, or a MicroBIT, sitting around waiting to be used
        creatively? Now is your chance to make a demo for a new platform!
      </p>
      <h3>Teletext</h3>
      <p>
       As count Count Binface once said: bring back teletext!
       </p>
      <p>
        We recommend using <a href="https://edit.tf">edit.tf</a> for this 
      </p>
      <h3>Young Field-FX</h3>
      <p>
        15 or younger and want to get creative? We have a special category for
        you! Scratch demos, animations, music, photography, whatever you shine
        at.
      </p>
      <h3>Music</h3>
      <p>If it makes sound you can enter it. Max running time 5 minutes.</p>
      <p>
        Anything goes as long as it's under 5 minutes.
      </p>
      <h3>Graphics</h3>
      <p>
        If it can be displayed on a projector screen and it doesn't move,it's
        graphics. From photography to executable graphics, Blender to weaving.
      </p>
      <h3>Wild</h3>
      <p>
        And then there is everything else. What could we possibly have missed?
      </p>
      <p>
        These competitions are quite broad because this is only a small party,
        but if a particular sub-category is very popular, we may (with the
        consent of the entrants) split the competition to make it fairer. For
        instance oldschool vs newschool or sizecoded vs full-size. All entries
        will be loved, respected, and cheered!
      </p>
