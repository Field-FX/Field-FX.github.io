        <h2> Field-FX 2022 - A demoparty in an tent at EMF Camp 2022</h2>

        <p>
          We are thrilled to be hosting a Revision Satellite this year. Join us
          in Limehouse, London, 15/04/2022 to 18/04/2022, to watch the stream on
          a big screen with a sound system, and most importantly, other sceners!
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a labour of love by enthusiasts. We are renting a venue, a
          projector and sound system for our friends in the UK demoscene to get
          together and take part in the Revision Demoparty.
          <a href="https://2022.revision-party.net/" target="_blank"
            >Check out the main site and the satellite concept here.</a
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          Anyone who is involved in or interested in the demoscene is welcome.
          We would love to see you there.
        </p>

        <h3>Watch the amazing invite to Field-FX 2022 & Inércia 2022 by Slipstream & ScenePt All Stars</h3>

        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>
          The venue is
          <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/HQd1E5fE7h3quL4e7" target="_blank"
            >Limehouse Town Hall, 646 Commercial Road, London</a
          >. We have a maximum capacity of 30 people, please respond soon if you
          are planning to come!
        </p>

        <p>
          We’ll provide a projector, sound system, and maybe some Revision
          goodies (if they arrive in time). There will be power and wifi and
          somewhere to sit (we hope). Need anything else? Bring it!
        </p>

        <p>
          It is closed overnight. You will have to make your own sleeping
          arrangements. We couldn’t find a venue that permitted the traditional
          demoscene activity of sleeping in sleeping bags under tables.

        <h2>Code of conduct</h2>

        <p>
          
Code of Conduct

We are committed to making Field FX and Young Field FX an inclusive and welcoming event.

Unfortunately, sometimes harassment happens in the demoscene community. We've set these ground rules to make it abundantly clear that this kind of behavior is not acceptable, so that everyone can feel comfortable attending Field FX. Everybody in the Field FX community is required to abide by this code of conduct on any of its online channels.
The Rules

We do not tolerate abuse, harassment, or discriminatory behavior of any form. Specifically:

    Do not engage in homophobic, biphobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, sexist, or otherwise prejudiced behavior.
    Do not harass people. Stalking, threatening behavior, and unwanted sexual attention is harassment.
    Everyone's personal space is their own. If you are asked to leave someone alone you must respect this.
    You may not use our channels to post personally-identifiable information.
    Sexualized language and imagery is not appropriate.
    Aggression and elitism are not welcome — do not belittle people for their knowledge or experience.

Reporting an Incident

If you are being harassed or witness a breach of this code of conduct, you can get in touch with us in the following ways:

Moderators will be present in online channels operated by Field FX and their identity will be established by a group message at regular intervals throughout the stream. Tagging them in your message will elicit a response.
Our Response

During our stream, we aim to reach a decision on all conduct issues within 10 minutes. Outside of channels operated by us, we cannot guarantee support.

All reports will be taken seriously and will be considered in confidence by our team.

If we believe you have violated this code of conduct we may issue you with a warning, with which you are expected to comply. If your behaviour is considered harmful, we may ban you from any online channels.

Serious breaches will result in your immediate banning from all channels and a ban from all future Field FX events. We may involve the police, with the consent of the victim.

If you have any comments or queries, you can get in touch at contact@field-fx.party. This Code of Conduct is derived from the EMF Camp code of conduct, which is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. This variant was last revised on 2020-07-02. No endorsement of Field FX by EMF Camp is implied by this usage.

        <h2>The Cost</h2>
        <p>
          We’re asking you to contribute if you can afford it to the cover the
          cost of the hall, if everyone put in TBC (won't be much) the hall
          would be covered. If you can’t afford to don't worry about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those of you that can't make it, note that the Revision 2022 party
          stream is going to be free for everyone to watch and submit prods to.
